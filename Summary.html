	The main objective of this research is to define the term of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specify its types and discuss AI 		applications in different fields of life, then mention the positive and negative effects of using AI, after that  predict the future 		aspects of AI. Finally, create a simple website using HTML to include shortly the material of this report.

 	In this short research, I gave a short introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) stating that the goal of artificial intelligence is to 	create computers whose intelligence equals or surpasses humans and mentioned the principle behind strong AI  and weak AI. After 	that, I explained the meaning of expert systems, data mining and artificial neural networks (ANN) so we can understand how AI 	works. I mentioned the most common areas in which AI is used and how it would be in the future.

 	Also, I explained how AI can affect human's life such that some people may lose their jobs, the matter which would lead to 	depression, crime and poverty. Using AI may lead to lack of creativity in responses at human. As technology advances , power 	machines and smart homes will be a very common sight in the future. Finally, HTML is a simple language that can engineering 	students can use to create their own websites.
