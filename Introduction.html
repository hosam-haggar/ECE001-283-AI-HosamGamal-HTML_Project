 Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as intelligence exhibited by an artificial entity to solve complex problems. AI concerned with making computers behave like humans. According to philosophy of AI, AI can be divided into two parts strong AI and weak AI. The principle behind strong AI is that the machines could be made to think or in other words could represent human minds in the future. The principle behind Weak AI is simply the fact that machines can be made to act as if they are intelligent. Pargrah here
